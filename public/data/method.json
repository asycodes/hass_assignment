  "intro": " Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is an ambitious project for China as it soars to connect herself with vast regions across Asia, Africa, and Europe. While it is no doubt seen as an enormous potential for economic growth, the initiative faces many criticisms regarding its true intentions and its ethical implications for workers and the environment. ",
  "for_title": "Ethical Methods",
  "for": "From recent articles, we understood that China prides itself on establishing and ensuring that the BRI structure will focus greatly on environmentally friendly practices, highlighting 'high-quality, sustainable growth' and collaboration with international organizations like the International Labour Organization (ILO) to promote labour standards (Kuhn, 2023).  Additionally, China claims to enforce 'Guiding Principles on Employment and Labor Standards for BRI Projects', implying they ensured and standardized fair wages and safe working conditions (Kuhn, 2023). This is further backed up by the UN Environment Programme, discussing that collaborative effort between UNEP and China are in the works to foster environmentally friendly practices within the BRI as UNEP aims to assist these BRI countries in achieving sustainable development through green investments and business practices (UNEP, 2024). Thus, these efforts and assurance suggest that China had genuine intention and commitment to ethical practices within the BRI framework. ",
  "against_title": "Unethical Methods",
  "against": "However, many critics highlight a lack of transparency in project contracting and labour practices, raising concerns about worker exploitation and Chinaâ€™s true agenda. Reports cite instances of low wages, excessive working hours, and inadequate safety standards for BRI construction workers (State Department, 2022). The opacity surrounding these practices casts doubt on the effectiveness of China's stated ethical commitments (International Labour Organization, 2017).  This suggests that there may be more than meets the eye and further efforts towards transparency and independent monitoring are crucial to ensure the ethical treatment of workers throughout the BRI program. Furthermore, despite the established guidelines and assurance, concerns still linger regarding worker rights and environmental impact while the large scale of BRI projects raising several environmental concerns. Construction of such infrastructure were estimated to result in damaging ecosystems, displace communities, and contribute to pollution. (Liu, 2022) These ethical issues threaten to undermine the initiative's long-term sustainability and social responsibility. Ensuring ethical practices throughout BRI's execution is critical for its success. Hence, was it all just a ruse for China to be the next powerhouse or was there substantial evidence that support otherwise? Ultimately, the BRI's future hinges on its ability to bridge the gap between its stated goals and agenda and the ethical concerns surrounding its implementation. China must address issues of transparency and worker rights while ensuring environmentally sustainable practices. Only then can the BRI achieve its full potential for positive development. "
